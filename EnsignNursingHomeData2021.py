# Coding Challenge #1: For each State that we operate in, on which [week_ending] did the average of our healthcare personal with a completed vaccination exceed 80%?

# Coding Challenge #2: For each of Our Providers, what is their longest streak (# of weeks) of residents not testing positive for Covid-19 ([residents_weekly_confirmed_covid_19])?

# Bonus Challenge: If the goal for each of the states we are in is to get all of our providers above 80% vaccination for both residents and patients â€” Draw mockups of the dashboard(s) you would propose in order to achieve this goal for each state.
